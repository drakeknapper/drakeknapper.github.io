<h2 style="font-family:courier;">About Me</h2>

<p title="About Me">
I am a recent graduate and I am ready to take on the world. <br>
I love science, expecially physics (which is what my degree is in). 
I like software development and technology, and am looking for a jo in this field. 
The outdoors are really cool, disc golf is my favorite outdoor activity. 
The last book I read was Shutter Island by Dennis Leary. I enjoy fitness and 
being active, and my favorite food is buffalo wings. Seriously if you know a good spot for
buffalo wings in Atlanta email me.
